# Next.js 15 App Router Routing Issue

This repository demonstrates a routing issue encountered in a Next.js 15 App Router application.  The About page fails to render when accessed directly through a URL, but works correctly when navigated to from the Home page.

## Bug Description

The application uses the App Router.  The Home page contains a link to the About page. When clicking this link, the About page renders as expected. However, when accessing `/about` directly in the browser, the page does not render, resulting in an error or an empty page.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (Home page).  The link to the About page works correctly.
5. Navigate directly to `http://localhost:3000/about`. The About page does not render correctly.

## Potential Causes

- Incorrect configuration of the App Router.
- An issue with client-side navigation compared to server-side navigation.
- A missing file or incorrect file path.

## Solution

The solution is provided in the `solutionContent` section and the `bugSolution.js` file, ensuring that both client-side and server-side rendering works correctly for both routes.
